If you use this code in your paper, please cite the above work.

The code is built with Python 3.7.1 and it requires Numpy and Scipy to run experiments and the algorithms themselves. 

Also, the code is built on top of sourcecode of the NeurIPS19 paper of Yoan Russac et al. "Weighted Linear Bandits in Non-Stationary Environments" https://github.com/YRussac/WeightedLinearBandits.
